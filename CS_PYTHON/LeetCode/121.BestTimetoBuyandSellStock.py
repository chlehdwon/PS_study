# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of
# a given stock on day i.

# If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction
# (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock),
# design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

# Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.


# Dynamic Programming Solution.
# For prices list for index 0 to index i,
# We put -(the cost of stock when we buy) at dp[i][0]
# And the maximum profit at dp[i][1]
